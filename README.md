# Lab5 – Java's Non-Primitive Types 

This repository contains solutions for **Lab 5** from the "Java's Non-Primitive Types" exercise at **Akademia Finansów i Biznesu Vistula**. The exercises were developed under the guidance of **mgr inż. Dominik Bielecki**.

## Contents 

- **Task1.java**  
  A program that creates a 10-element array and fills it with numbers from 9 to 0 using a classic `for` loop and displays the elements using a for-each loop.

- **Task2.java**  
  A program that generates a one-dimensional array of 10 random numbers (from 1 to 100), and finds the smallest and largest values using a loop.

- **Task3.java**  
  A program that creates a 10x10 two-dimensional array named `matrix`. It places numbers from 0 to 9 along the diagonal, fills other elements with 0, and calculates the sum of the diagonal elements.

- **Task4.java**  
  A program that takes two user-input strings and concatenates them in both orders. It then compares the concatenated strings and checks for alternation.

- **Task5.java**  
  A program that checks whether a word entered by the user is a palindrome. Before checking, it converts the word to lowercase.
